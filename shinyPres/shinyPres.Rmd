## Background

- working for Allianz Technology since 4 years as head of a small AI team
- working with <img src="pic/R_logo.svg.png" height = "30px">
- building dashboards and "apps" with <img src="pic/shiny.png" height="40px">
- giving presentations to management and talks on conferences  
- like to work with ML, AI, Big Data,...  


## Collection of ideas for presentation

- What is Shiny?
- What is it good for?
- Getting started
- some examples
- packages around Shiny (network graph from CRAN? + "Zoom in" for the most intersting packages)
- tips and tricks?


## What is Shiny?

**Shiny** is an **R package** that makes it easy to build **interactive web apps** straight from **R**.  
You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards.*

Shiny combines the **computational power of R** with the **interactivity** of the modern web.*

**Shiny** apps are written in <img src="pic/R_logo.svg.png" height = "30px"> and run in <img src="pic/R_logo.svg.png" height = "30px">.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(shiny)
selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20)

## What is Shiny?

### ui.R
UI Elements for Input like `selectInput()`, `sliderInput()`, `textInput()`, `radioButtons()` `actionButton()` etc.  
and  
Output like `plotOutput()`, `tableOutput()`, `htmlOutput()`, `uiOutput()` etc.

### server.R

Bring UI to life with action  

`renderPlot()`, `renderTable()`, `renderUI()`, `renderText()` etc.
